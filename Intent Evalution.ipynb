      "  I'm contacting you as I believe I have been scammed. I had purchased services from a Company called Twicsy Official which I believe is an Indian company. They had advised that they are willing to proceed with a refund as I had found their services unsatisfactory, contingent on the fact that I close the pending case I have with Paypal (non related issue).   \n",
      "  Paypal had deducted my money from the wrong account and I had opened a case with them to attempt to rectify that mistake. Meanwhile, Twicsy and I have agreed to a refund and they mentioned they will be able to proceed with the refund if I cancel the pending Paypal case. After doing so, Twicsy assured that they will process the refund but it has been almost 2 weeks and I have not heard back from them. I believe that they have tricked me into closing the Paypal case so Paypal can release the funds to them and had no intention of refunding me my money anyway.   \n",
      "  I have reached out to Paypal and they have opened a case on their end and they have advised me to do so with my bank as well, hence this email. You may find my conversation with Twicsy attached, I had contacted them on Paypal in which I had gotten no reply, and separately on Instagram, which you can see through the screenshots I have attached that they had continued with the conversation about a refund for a few days before ghosting entirely.   \n",
      "  The amount may be small, but it's a matter of principle. If they are doing this to me, they are most likely doing it to many others as well. What can we do to curb this scam?   \n",
      "  The amount I paid was 15USD and I've just realised that it cost 15SGD to open a dispute case with you, can I check why that would be the case? I am a scam victim but I am liable to pay extra to have my case heard? I'm sorry, I'm just puzzled at this and would love to hear your thoughts and advice on the matter.   \n",
